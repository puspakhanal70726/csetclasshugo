      <description>Working with the group was very helpful, and my team helped me a lot. Sometimes, if I could not figure things out, I talked to the group, and they helped me out. Pair programming is an excellent way to interact with a team. It is a good experience to use Github, SourceTree, and Git. Every time I write code, if I cannot find something, I place whatever I have done into a repository, and I send it for peer review.</description>

      <description>The best way to get familiar with the project is to read the repository including the license, README file, Contributing file, Code of Conduct, and other documentation. After I read all those files, I found a resource where I could find open-source projects. Among those, I found that Open Source Friday is a good resource for open-source projects. The most important part is that the contribution must be meaningful to the project, and if we get a positive response, that means you have gained some level of experience.</description>
